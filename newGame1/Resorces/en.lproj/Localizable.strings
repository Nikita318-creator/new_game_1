//RulesText
"RulesText" = "Game Objective: Accumulate as many 'game minutes' as possible. They are displayed in the top right corner of the main screen, next to game coins. One minute spent in the game equals one in-game currency called 'game minute'. However, there are times when one minute in the game earns 3, 4, 5, or more 'game minutes'. To find out how many minutes are currently being credited, check the chart.

The chart grows as notifications from the game arrive and are saved for a certain time. This is influenced by the number of players taking on the challenge. The more players participating at the moment, the higher the reward per completed level.

Tip: When a notification arrives, more players join the game, and the reward chart for minutes increases.

Chapters remain locked until you complete the current chapter.

To improve letter placement, spin the drum more often. Just tap on the area where it is located.

If you want to unlock a unique Drum, Font, open a word, or get a hint, you need to pay a certain amount of game coins (not to be confused with 'game minutes'). Coins are credited for daily logins to the game — if you log in every day, the number of reward coins increases. Coins can also be purchased.

Good luck with the game!
